/// Enum representing the various states of a pageable data source.
///
/// This enum is used to track the current loading and error status
/// when working with paginated data, such as lists or grids.
/// It covers the full lifecycle from initial state, loading,
/// success, error, empty results, and completion.
///
/// The states include:
/// - [INITIAL]: No data has been loaded yet.
/// - [LOADING_FIRST_PAGE]: The first page is currently loading.
/// - [LOADED_FIRST_PAGE]: The first page has loaded successfully with items.
/// - [LOADING_NEW_PAGE]: Additional pages are currently loading.
/// - [NO_ITEMS_FOUND]: The first page loaded but contained no items.
/// - [FIRST_PAGE_ERROR]: An error occurred while loading the first page.
/// - [NEW_PAGE_ERROR]: An error occurred while loading additional pages.
/// - [COMPLETED]: All pages have been loaded, no more data available.
///
/// Example usage:
/// ```dart
/// if (status.isLoadingFirstPage) {
///   return CircularProgressIndicator();
/// } else if (status.hasError) {
///   return ErrorWidget();
/// } else if (status.isCompleted) {
///   return Text('All items loaded');
/// }
/// ```
