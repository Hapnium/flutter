/// {@template in_app_notification_service}
/// An abstract service for handling in-app notifications.
///
/// The [InAppNotificationInterface] defines the contract for how notifications
/// should be received, displayed, and interacted with while the app is running.
///
/// It is a generic class that supports typed data for notification payloads.
/// This allows implementations to specialize in handling different types of
/// domain models, such as messages, trips, or events.
///
/// ### Example
/// ```dart
/// class ChatNotificationService extends InAppNotificationService<ChatMessage> {
///   @override
///   void dismissInAppNotification(String id) {
///     // Custom logic to show chat popup, etc.
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This abstraction is useful for implementing modular notification pipelines
/// and decoupling platform-specific delivery logic from UI-level handling.
/// {@endtemplate}

  /// @param duration The duration for which the notification will be displayed, in seconds. Defaults to 5.
  /// @param onTapped Optional callback to be called when the notification is tapped.
  /// @param onClosed Optional callback to be called when the notification is closed.
