  /// 1. Initializes Hive using `Hive.initFlutter()`.
  /// 2. Opens all registered repositories by calling the `open()` method on
  ///    each repository, passing the configured `prefix`, `deviceName`, `platform`,
  ///    and `showLogs` values.
  /// 3. Calls the `setup()` method to allow subclasses to perform any
  ///    additional setup logic.
  ///
  /// This method should be called early in your application's lifecycle,
  /// typically in the `main` function or before using any repositories.
